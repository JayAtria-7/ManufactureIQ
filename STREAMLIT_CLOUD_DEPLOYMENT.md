# 🚀 ManufactureIQ - Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Your GitHub Repository
**URL:** https://github.com/JayAtria-7/ManufactureIQ.git

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### **Step 1: Verify GitHub Repository Setup**

First, make sure these files are in your GitHub repository:

**Required Files:**
```
ManufactureIQ/
├── app/
│   └── streamlit_app_v2.py          ← Main UI file
├── models/
│   ├── model_pipeline.pkl           ← Trained model
│   └── metadata.json                ← Model metadata
├── .streamlit/
│   └── config.toml                  ← Theme configuration
├── requirements_streamlit.txt       ← Dependencies for cloud
└── README.md                        ← Project description
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you're using `requirements_streamlit.txt` (not `requirements.txt`) for deployment.

---

### **Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**

#### **2.1 Go to Streamlit Cloud**
Visit: **https://share.streamlit.io**

#### **2.2 Sign In**
- Click **"Sign in"**
- Choose **"Continue with GitHub"**
- Authorize Streamlit to access your GitHub account

#### **2.3 Create New App**
1. Click **"New app"** button (top right)
2. You'll see a deployment form

#### **2.4 Fill in Deployment Settings**

**Repository:**
```
JayAtria-7/ManufactureIQ
```

**Branch:**
```
main
```
(or `master` if that's your default branch)

**Main file path:**
```
app/streamlit_app_v2.py
```

**App URL (optional - customize if you want):**
```
manufactureiq
```
This will create: `https://manufactureiq.streamlit.app`

#### **2.5 Advanced Settings (Optional)**

Click **"Advanced settings"** and add:

**Python version:**
```
3.11
```

**Secrets:** (Leave empty for now - you don't need any)

#### **2.6 Deploy!**
Click the **"Deploy!"** button

---

### **Step 3: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)**

Streamlit Cloud will:
1. ✅ Clone your repository
2. ✅ Install dependencies from `requirements_streamlit.txt`
3. ✅ Load your model files
4. ✅ Start the app
5. ✅ Provide you a public URL

**Progress indicators:**
- "Cloning repository..."
- "Installing dependencies..."
- "Starting app..."
- "App is live!"

---

### **Step 4: Access Your Live App**

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://manufactureiq.streamlit.app
```

or

```
https://jayatria-7-manufactureiq-appstreamlit-app-v2-xyz123.streamlit.app
```

**Share this URL with anyone!** No login required for viewers.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: "ModuleNotFoundError"**

**Problem:** Missing dependencies

**Solution:** Make sure `requirements_streamlit.txt` exists in your repo with:
```
pandas==2.2.3
numpy==2.2.4
scikit-learn==1.7.2
joblib==1.4.2
streamlit==1.50.0
plotly==6.3.1
```

---

### **Issue 2: "File not found: app/streamlit_app_v2.py"**

**Problem:** Incorrect file path

**Solution:** Check that the file exists in your repo at exactly:
```
app/streamlit_app_v2.py
```

Use forward slashes (`/`) not backslashes (`\`)

---

### **Issue 3: "Model file too large"**

**Problem:** `model_pipeline.pkl` exceeds GitHub's 100MB limit

**Solution:** 
1. Check file size: Should be under 100MB
2. If larger, use Git LFS (Large File Storage)
3. Or compress the model

---

### **Issue 4: "Config option error"**

**Problem:** Deprecated config in `.streamlit/config.toml`

**Solution:** Your config is already fixed! Should contain:
```toml
[server]
headless = true

[theme]
primaryColor = "#3b82f6"
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f8fafc"
textColor = "#0f172a"
font = "sans serif"

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false
```
