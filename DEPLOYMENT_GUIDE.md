## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

### Test Enhanced UI Locally:

streamlit run app\streamlit_app_v2.py --server.port 8501
```

### Create GitHub Repo (using Git):

```cmd
cd e:\project\cap1
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - SmartManufacture AI"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/manufacturing-ai-predictor.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found" error on Streamlit Cloud

**Solution:** Make sure `requirements_streamlit.txt` includes all dependencies:
```
pandas==2.2.3
numpy==2.2.4
scikit-learn==1.7.2
joblib==1.4.2
streamlit==1.50.0
plotly==6.3.1
```

### Issue: Model file too large

**Solution:** GitHub has 100MB file limit. If `model_pipeline.pkl` is too large:
1. Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)
2. Or compress the model
3. Or retrain with smaller dataset

### Issue: App not loading

**Solution:** Check Streamlit Cloud logs:
1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Click "Manage app"
3. View logs for error messages

### Issue: Wrong file path

**Solution:** Make sure the main file path is:
```
app/streamlit_app_v2.py
```
(Not `streamlit_app_v2.py` or `app\streamlit_app_v2.py`)

Streamlit Cloud allows custom domains:

1. Buy a domain (e.g., from Namecheap, GoDaddy)
2. Go to your app settings in Streamlit Cloud
