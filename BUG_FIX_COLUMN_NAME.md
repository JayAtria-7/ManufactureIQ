# 🔧 Bug Fix: Column Name Mismatch

## ✅ Issue Fixed: "columns are missing: {'Material_Viscosity'}"

---

## 🐛 Problem

When clicking "GENERATE PREDICTION" in the v2.0 UI, you received this error:
```
Prediction error: columns are missing: {'Material_Viscosity'}
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Column name mismatch:**
- The trained model expects: `Material_Viscosity`
- The v2.0 UI was sending: `Melt_Viscosity`

This happened because:
1. The original dataset uses `Melt_Viscosity`
2. During training, it was renamed to `Material_Viscosity` 
3. The v1.0 UI used the correct name (`Material_Viscosity`)
4. The v2.0 UI accidentally used the old name (`Melt_Viscosity`)

## ✅ Solution Applied

Changed in `app/streamlit_app_v2.py` line 294:

**Before:**
```python
'Melt_Viscosity': melt_viscosity,
```

**After:**
```python
'Material_Viscosity': melt_viscosity,
```

## 🎯 Testing

The fix has been applied and the UI restarted.

**New URL:** http://localhost:8503

**To test:**
1. Open http://localhost:8503
2. Adjust the sliders
3. Click "🚀 GENERATE PREDICTION"
4. You should now see the prediction without errors!

## 📋 Other Fixes Applied

Also cleaned up the `.streamlit/config.toml` to remove deprecated options:
- Removed `general.email` (deprecated)
- Removed `server.enableCORS` (conflicting with XSRF protection)

## ✅ Status

**Fixed!** The enhanced UI v2.0 now works correctly. 🎉

**Current Working UIs:**
- v1.0 Original: http://localhost:8501 ✅
- v2.0 Enhanced: http://localhost:8503 ✅ (Fixed!)

Both are fully functional now!
